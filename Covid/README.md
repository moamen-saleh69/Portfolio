# 🌍 Global COVID-19 Tracker

### 📊 Dashboard Overview
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard tracking the global spread, impact, and mitigation of COVID-19. This project transforms raw global data into an interactive "Command Center" interface, visualizing key metrics like reproduction rates, vaccination progress, and life expectancy impacts.
