### 🔍 Key Business Questions Answered
* **Income & Gender:** Do higher-income earners buy more bikes? How does gender influence purchasing power?
* **Commute Distance:** Does the distance a customer travels to work impact their likelihood of buying a bike?
* **Age Demographics:** Which age bracket is our primary target market?

### 🛠️ Process & Tools Used
**Microsoft Excel (Full Stack Analysis)**
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, standardized marital status (M/S to Married/Single), and fixed inconsistent gender labels.
2.  **Data Processing:** Utilized **Pivot Tables** to aggregate sales data and calculate averages/counts.
3.  **Visualization:** Built interactive charts (Clustered Bar, Line, and Column charts) to visualize trends.
4.  **UI Design:** Created a dynamic dashboard with **Slicers** allowing users to filter by Gender and Marital Status.

### 💡 Insights Discovered
* **The "Sweet Spot" Commute:** Customers with a commute of **0-1 Miles** are the most likely to purchase a bike, suggesting a strong market for casual/local riders.
* **Income Disparity:** While male customers generally have a higher average income, female purchase rates remain competitive in the middle-income bracket.
* **Middle Age Dominance:** The "Middle Age" bracket shows the highest volume of purchases, indicating this should be the primary target for marketing campaigns.
