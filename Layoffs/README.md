## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes the post-pandemic "Tech Winter," tracking job losses across 1,000+ companies from 2020 to 2023. The goal was to identify industry trends, quantify the impact of major economic shifts, and visualize the "boom and bust" cycle of the tech sector.

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
1.  **When did the layoffs peak?** Identifying the specific months where the "Tech Winter" hit hardest.
2.  **Which companies were the "Villains"?** Ranking companies by total employees laid off vs. percentage of workforce.
3.  **Who went bankrupt?** Identifying the 116 startups that laid off 100% of their staff.
4.  **Global Impact:** Visualizing which countries outside the US were hit hardest.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **SQL Server:** Used for data cleaning, standardization, and complex queries (CTEs, Window Functions, Rolling Totals).
* **Tableau:** Built an interactive dashboard with drill-down filters and geospatial analysis.
* **Excel:** Initial data auditing and CSV handling.

## 🧠 Key Insights
* **The 2023 Spike:** Layoffs peaked in early 2023, with nearly 90,000 jobs lost in a single month, marking the height of the crisis.
* **Big Tech Dominance:** While thousands of companies cut costs, the sheer volume was driven by the "Big Four" (Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft).
* **Startup Extinction:** 116 companies in the dataset went "100% bust," effectively ceasing operations.
